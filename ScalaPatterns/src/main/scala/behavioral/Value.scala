/**
 * Value object is a small immutable object that represents a simple entity whose equality isnâ€™t based on identity. Value objects are equal if all their fields are equal.
 * Value objects are widely used to represent numbers, dates, colors, etc. In enterprise applications they are used as DTOs a for inter-process communication.
 * Because of the immutability, value objects are handy in multi-threaded programing.
 *
 * Case classes exports constructor parameters as properties. By default, case classes are immutable.
 * Another approach could be using tuple sets
